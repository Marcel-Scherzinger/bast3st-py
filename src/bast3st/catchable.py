class err(enum.Flag):
    """
    Collection of all :ref:`catchable-errors` that can occur in any situation.

    As described in :class:`enum.Flag`, you can use bitwise operations to combine
    the error names from this type. Thisway, you can filter out arbitrary combinations
    of different error causes.

    Never rely on the exact numeric values of the following constants.
    They are not stable and not considered part of the api.

    (You can click on the `[source]` button to see how compound flags are defined.)

    .. warning:: Compound error-values don't exist at the json level and are serialized
        as a :code:`|`-separated list of their parts, so if e. g. a new server version
        would introduce a new error kind, your previously (with an old version)
        serialized and uploaded specification won't catch this error even though it
        might belong to a group whose compound flag you used.
        You then have to use a new version of this library to re-serialize the spec.
